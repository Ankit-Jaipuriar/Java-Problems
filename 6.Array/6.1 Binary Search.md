# 6.1 Binary Search
In Binary Search
for ex:- a array 2,4,6,10,12,13

if we have to find the index where 12 is stored then  we have to find the mid value

if mid value > number then the sub array that generated whose end value will become equal to mid-1;

if mid value < number then the sub array that generated whose start value will become equal to mid+1;

This way we can easily find the index of that number more fastly and efficiently.

## Program
```java
public class BinarySearch {
    public static int BinarySearch(int number[],int key){
    int start=0 , end= number.length-1;
    while(start<=end){
        int mid=(start+end)/2;
        if(number[mid]==key){
            return mid;
        }
        if(number[mid]>key){
            end=mid-1;
        }
        else{
            start=mid+1;
        }
    }
    return -1;   

    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int number[]={2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10};
        int key =7;
        System.out.println(BinarySearch(number, key));
    }

    
}
```
