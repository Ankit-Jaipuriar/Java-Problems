Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter the year:");
int year=sc.nextInt();
boolean x=(year % 4==0);
boolean y=(year % 100!=0);
boolean z=((year%100==0) && (year%400==0));
if(x && (y || z)){
    System.out.println(year + " is a leap year");
}
else{
    System.out.println(year + " is not a leap year");
